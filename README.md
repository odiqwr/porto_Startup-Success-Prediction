# Inventory Pattern Optimization (I-POP)

> Inventory Optimization with Product Reorder Detection Using Unsupervised Learning

## 🚀 Overview

Many businesses face challenges in managing inventory because it is difficult to predict the timing and quantity of product reorders. Through this project, **I-POP** (*Inventory Product Order Prediction*) is present as a system that utilizes the **Association Rule Learning** method to analyze purchasing patterns and recommend product reorders automatically. This solution helps businesses prevent stock shortages, reduce waste and increase operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Optimize inventory management by reducing stockouts and overstocks through data-driven reorder recommendations.
- Apply unsupervised learning (Association Rule Learning) to discover product purchase patterns without labeled data.
- Build a reusable pipeline for rule extraction and evaluate its integration potential in real-time inventory systems.

## 📊 Dataset

## 🧠 Learned

- Implemented FP-Growth for extracting product association rules from transactional data.
- Performed data preprocessing and transformation tailored for unsupervised learning.
- Visualized item patterns and rule metrics to support inventory decision-making.
- Used GitHub and Google Colab for version control and cloud-based experimentation.

## 🌱 Future Work

- Integrate the model with real-time inventory systems for automated reorder actions.
- Extend the analysis with temporal and seasonal data to capture dynamic demand patterns.
- Combine unsupervised and supervised learning to improve prediction accuracy.

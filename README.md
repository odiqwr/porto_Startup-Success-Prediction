# Startup Success Prediction

> Predicting Startup Feasibility for Investment Decision Support Using Supervised Learning

## 📌 Overview

Many startups fail in the first few years due to lack of funding, poor business models, or market mismatch. Through this project, SSP (Startup Success Prediction) is developed as a system that uses classification learning to predict whether a startup will succeed or fail based on its key characteristics. This model aims to support investors and entrepreneurs in making more accurate and effective decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Drive effective business decision making through measurable and reliable data predictions.
- Evaluation and comparison of the performance of nine supervised learning algorithms for startup success status classification
- Development of a predictive system ready to be implemented as a tool for selecting and assessing start-up companies.

## 🧠 Learned

- Built a complete ML pipeline for binary classification using startup data.
- Performed data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Conducted feature selection and model tuning to improve accuracy.
- Visualized key patterns related to startup success using EDA techniques.

## 🌱 Future Work
